## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Game Concept (MVP)

"Autobahn" (MVP) is a browser-based incremental idle game where players begin by salvaging materials from their garage workshop and manually crafting basic automotive components. The game features a hybrid starting approach: players begin with small amounts of basic materials (Wire Stock, Sheet Metal, Leather Scraps, Oil) but can always generate more through the "Salvage Materials" action. This ensures immediate engagement while providing a reliable fallback mechanism.

The game emphasizes realistic early automobile manufacturing, beginning with the most basic components that a single person could reasonably produce and sell, progressing through automation and eventually sophisticated stock control systems.

### 1.2. Target Audience

Players who enjoy the core loop of incremental games: manual input leading to automation, resource management, and satisfying progression through efficiency gains. Fans of industrial and historical themes will particularly appreciate the early 20th century automobile manufacturing setting.

### 1.3. Core Gameplay Loop (MVP)

Players start with small amounts of basic materials and an always-available "Salvage Materials" action. These materials can be crafted into simple automotive parts and sold for profit. As the player progresses, market systems are revealed and automation becomes available, eventually leading to sophisticated stock control systems.

**Core Loop:** Salvage Materials â†’ Manual Crafting â†’ Market Sales â†’ Resource Accumulation â†’ Automation â†’ Stock Control

### 1.4. Theme & Setting (MVP)

The game is set in the very early 20th century (1900-1910), focusing on a garage-based automotive parts business. The player starts as an individual craftsperson with basic materials and the ability to salvage more from their workshop, making simple automotive components that were commonly produced by small workshops and sold to early automobile manufacturers.

### 1.5. Anti-Softlock Design

The "Salvage Materials" action serves as the primary anti-softlock mechanism. This action is always available, requires no resources, has no time cost, and provides one random basic raw material per click. Combined with the starting materials, this ensures players can always recover from any resource-depleted state and continue progressing.

## 2. Core Mechanics (MVP)

### 2.1. Player Actions

- **Salvage Materials (Primary Action):** Always-available action that provides one random basic raw material (Wire Stock, Sheet Metal, Leather Scraps, or Oil) per click. Serves as the fundamental anti-softlock mechanism and provides immediate player engagement.

- **Manual Crafting:** Transform materials into automotive components through timed crafting actions (1.5-8 seconds). Available recipes: Wire Springs, Metal Brackets, Leather Gaskets, Spring Assemblies, and Repair Kits.

- **Integrated Market Trading:** Buy raw materials and sell finished products through inline market controls integrated directly into the resource display.

- **Building & Upgrading:** Construct and improve automated machines within the workshop (Wire Bending Jig, Filing Station).

- **Stock Control Management:** Hire personnel to manage automated buying and selling rules, reducing manual market interaction.

### 2.2. Resource Management

#### Basic Raw Materials:
- **Wire Stock:** Basic metal wire for springs and small components (starting: 5, salvageable)
- **Sheet Metal:** Thin metal sheets for brackets and simple parts (starting: 3, salvageable)
- **Leather Scraps:** For gaskets and simple seals (starting: 2, salvageable)
- **Oil:** For lubrication and treatment (starting: 1, salvageable)

#### Basic Processed Components:
- **Wire Springs:** Hand-bent springs for various automotive uses
- **Metal Brackets:** Filed and shaped mounting brackets
- **Leather Gaskets:** Cut gaskets for sealing

#### Intermediate Parts:
- **Spring Assemblies:** Multiple springs combined for suspension
- **Automotive Repair Kits:** Complete sets of common replacement parts

#### Currency:
- **Marks:** In-game currency earned from selling parts and used for purchasing materials and automation (starting: 0)

### 2.3. Automation Systems

#### Production Automation:
- **Wire Bending Jig:** Automates wire spring production (2x slower than manual, upgradeable)
- **Filing Station:** Automates bracket filing and shaping (2x slower than manual, upgradeable)

Each machine:
- Has three states: Running (ðŸŸ¢), Waiting for Resources (ðŸŸ¡), Stopped (ðŸ”´)
- Starts in stopped state when built
- Can be manually started/stopped
- Automatically transitions to "waiting for resources" when inputs are unavailable
- Can be upgraded to improve efficiency (15% faster per level, max 2x faster than manual)
- Shows real-time progress bars when running

#### Stock Control Systems:
- **Material Procurement Specialist:** Automated purchasing of raw materials (â‚¬2/10s salary)
- **Sales Manager:** Automated selling of finished products (â‚¬3/10s salary)
- **Supply Chain Coordinator:** Advanced optimization of both buying and selling (â‚¬5/10s salary)

Personnel require ongoing salaries and will quit if unpaid, providing risk/reward balance.

### 2.4. Progression Systems

- **Milestone-Based Unlocks:** New crafting recipes, machines, and stock control options unlock based on production milestones and market activity.
- **Part Complexity Tree:** More complex parts require simpler parts as components, creating natural progression.
- **Stock Control Evolution:** Market automation systems unlock after demonstrating trading proficiency.

### 2.5. Progressive Disclosure

The game reveals systems and UI elements only when they become relevant:
- **Salvage Materials** button is immediately visible and functional
- **Market controls** appear inline with resources after first craft
- **Stock Control panels** unlock after reaching trading volume milestones
- **Advanced automation** becomes available as production scales up

## 3. Game Systems (MVP)

### 3.1. Economy & Balancing

- **Baseline Resource Generation:** The "Salvage Materials" action provides constant, slow baseline resource generation, ensuring recovery from any depleted state.
- **Market Integration:** Inline buy/sell controls integrated directly into resource display make trading fluid and immediate.
- **Profit Margins:** Balanced to make manual crafting profitable initially, with automation providing efficiency gains.
- **Stock Control Economics:** Automated trading systems introduce ongoing costs that must be balanced against efficiency gains.

### 3.2. Milestone System

Current milestone progression:
1. **First Wire Spring** â†’ Unlocks Spring Assembly crafting + Market visibility
2. **Spring Production (10 wire springs)** â†’ Unlocks Wire Bending Jig
3. **First Assembly** â†’ Unlocks Repair Kit crafting + Filing Station
4. **First Sale** â†’ Market integration milestone
5. **Market Experience (10 transactions)** â†’ Unlocks basic stock control personnel
6. **Basic Automation** â†’ Unlocks advanced Supply Chain Coordinator

### 3.3. Stock Control System

**Implementation Overview:**
The Stock Control System allows players to hire trading personnel who manage market transactions automatically based on configured rules. Personnel require ongoing salaries (paid every 10 seconds) and will quit if unpaid.

**Personnel Types:**

*Material Procurement Specialist:*
- **Role:** Automatically purchases raw materials when inventory falls below thresholds
- **Salary:** â‚¬2 per 10-second interval
- **Hiring Cost:** â‚¬50 + first payment
- **Capabilities:** Auto-buy raw materials, inventory monitoring

*Sales Manager:*

*Supply Chain Coordinator:*
- **Role:** Advanced optimization of both buying and selling
- **Salary:** â‚¬5 per 10-second interval
- **Hiring Cost:** â‚¬100 + first payment
- **Unlock:** Requires hiring both basic specialists first
- **Capabilities:** Advanced optimization, profit analysis, full supply chain management

**Rule Management:**
- Quick rule creation for common scenarios (auto-buy materials when < 5, auto-sell products when > 10)
- Individual rule management with enable/disable toggles
- Rules automatically disabled when managing personnel are fired
- Rules execute every 5 seconds to prevent spam

**Economic Mechanics:**
- Salaries deducted every 10 seconds of real-time gameplay
